            For this programming project, you are going to implement a web proxy
            server. This proxy server gets request messages from clients (web
            browsers), forwards the requests to target web server or another
            proxy server, obtains the corresponding response messages and sends
            the responses back to the clients. This proxy server should be able
            to handle all kinds of objects, not just HTML pages, but also images
            and audio files. Moreover, this proxy server should support
            persistent connections; a timeout timer should be used to terminate
            idle connection from client. To reduce the complexity of this
            programming project, the proxy server does not support caching
            mechanism.

        <p>
          <span>HTTP</span> is the transfer protocol used throughout the WWW.
          The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol. When a client opens
          a connection, it immediately sends its request for a file. The web
          server then responds with the file or an error message. Each
          interaction consists of one request and one reply. Both are MIME-like
          message (MIME: The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions). Each
          request message includes a request line, a few header lines, a blank
          line, and the possible message body. Similar is the response message.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Each request message includes a request line, a few header lines, a
          blank line, and the possible message body. Similar is the response
          message.
        </p>
        <br />
        <i>
          Request-message = request-line *(message-header CRLF) CRLF [
          message-body ]
        </i>
        <br />
        <i>
          Response-message = status-line *(message-header CRLF) CRLF [
          message-body ]
        </i>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          For example, below are the request/response messages sent by a web
          client (curl) to the server to download a web document:

            <span>Figure 2. Sample Web Request/Response messages</span>
          </div>
          <h4>Non-Persistent Connection and Persistent Connection</h4>
          <p>
            In HTTP 1.0, after the TCP connection was established, a single
            request was sent over and a single response was sent back. Then the
            TCP connection was released. Establishing a separate connection for
            each file request incurs expensive overhead. In view of this
            deficiency, HTTP 1.1 was designed to support persistent connections.
            In HTTP 1.1, it is possible to establish a TCP connection, sends a
            request and gets a response, and then sends additional requests and
            gets additional responses. Our proxy server should support
            persistent connections between web clients and itself as well as
            between itself and target web/proxy servers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If an HTTP 1.1 client sends multiple requests through a single
            connection, the server should send responses back in the same order
            as the requests - this is all it takes for a server to support
            persistent connections. The server should close a connection after
            the connection has been idle for long enough duration (not defined
            in the specification; usually set to 10 - 15 seconds).
